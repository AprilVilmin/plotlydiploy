# Belly Button Beef, JavaScript and Plotly 

## Overview of Project
Roza's lab has teamed up with a food company, Improbably Beef, to try to find a synthetic beef substitute. Roza uses her position as a microbiological researcher to theorize that the bacteria in the human belly button, might have the taste closest to beef. The plan is to collect samples from various research participants. She plans on assigning everyone in the study an ID number to keep their identity secure. Participants and researchers alike will be able to log into a website to see what kind of bacteria has been cultured in each participant .
